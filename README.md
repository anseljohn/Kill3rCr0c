It is advised not to use this script until all have been tested.
.
Currently I have only Ubuntu scripts but I will have powershell sooner or later.

Scripts are number coded...:

0)  Main call file
1)  Installing and purging/removing
2)  Configuration
3)  User Security

REMEMBER TO sudo su OR NOTHING WILL WORK
